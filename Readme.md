This is a starter repository for using Obsidian with Zotero for researchers. I'll try to update this if people have problems with things!

There is some [Basic Obsidian functionality](./Basic%20Obsidian%20functionality.md) and some [Other helpful research stuff](./Other%20helpful%20research%20stuff.md).
